#God, I'm tired  

- How does the Bible talk about exhaustion?
- Is this interesting? Is this relatable?

##Project intent  
This project is a submission for Nanogenmo 2020, where I intend to scrape through the KJV Bible and collate all the verses about rest, sleep, exhaustion, fatigue, etc into chapters. I want to explore The Bible as a text, and explore alternative ways of reading it. Nanogenmo rules specify "50,000 words of _fiction_" - I am not saying that the Bible is a work of fiction, but by combining the verses I will be creating a work of fiction. 

##Project plan
- Find good source of Bible (haha, find the 'best' bible)
- Scrape into a structured dataset
- Layout as a printable document of 50,000+ words
