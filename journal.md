Went looking for bible txt to scrape, found a good .txt file from the gutenberg project
Wrote a basic script to pick out lines with sleepy words in them and collate into a file to test the wordcount, kept adding words to my list of words until the word count was high enough. This is good, it forced me to consider my words more and what constitutes "tired" language

Changed the index script to create the "tired bible" object that I'll use to make the novel.
Added this journal component. I'll look into bindery and figure out how to lay this out
